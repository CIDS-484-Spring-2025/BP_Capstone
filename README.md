# Artist Setlist Aggregator

## Project Overview:

The idea of the **Artist Setlist Aggregator** is to serve as a web application that allows users to search for their favorite musicians and view their **average setlist and other insightful statistics** generated from a given range of recent concerts by working with data from the Setlist.fm API.


This project will venture into the world of full-stack development by integrating a **React frontend**, a **Spring Boot backend**, and a **PostgreSQL database**. It will involve use of multiple programming languages including Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and SQL. There will also be a Backend API integration using HTTP methods and JSON parsing to retrieve and process data. Implementation of efficient data flow will be achieved by building a structured data pipeline to process and store statistics.

## Technologies Used:
### Front End-
* React.js Framework
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

### Back End-
* Java with Spring Boot
* PostgreSQL Database
* pgAdmin
* Setlist.fm API
* Maven
* Postman
* Node.js
* npm



## Goals:
* Create a user-friendly interface for searching artists.
* Fetch and process setlist data from the Setlist.fm API into insightful statistics.
* Generate an average setlist based on recent concerts.
* Display setlist statistics (rare songs, variations, guest performers,frequent encores etc).
* Allow users to save searches in a PostgreSQL database.

## Current Progress:
* Set up technology stack on multiple devices for efficient development
* Deployed and tested React frontend and Spring Boot backend
* Verified front-end to back-end connectivity with Postman

## Future Timeline:
### Milestone 2-
* Set up database and define table structures
* Create bare-bones user interface and search forms
* Implement initial API-to-database functionality
